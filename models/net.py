    This is the standard way to define your own network in PyTorch. You typically choose the components
    (e.g. LSTMs, linear layers etc.) of your network in the __init__ function. You then apply these layers
    on the input step-by-step in the forward function. You can use torch.nn.functional to apply functions
    such as F.relu, F.sigmoid, F.softmax, F.max_pool2d. Be careful to ensure your dimensions are correct after each
    step. You are encouraged to have a look at the network in pytorch/nlp/model/net.py to get a better sense of how
    you can go about defining your own network.
